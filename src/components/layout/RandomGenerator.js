                    We have all been there. With a group of friends, starving, but no one can make a decision. 
                    Should we get Thai? or pizza?
                    
                    STFU&EAT acts as your trigger man, providing a random restaurant recommendation for those hangry moments.
                    <br/>
                    <br/>All local St. Louis CITY restaurants that are under $25 for one person, chains excluded.

                    The best part? Great food and no obligation to go to the place suggested by your friend of a friend of a friend. 
                    You get the idea. 
                    <br/>

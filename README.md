# STFU&EAT
We have all been there. With a group of friends, starving, but no one can choose where to eat.
Should we get Thai? or pizza? 

STFU&EAT acts as your trigger man, providing a random restaurant recommendation for those hangry moments. 
All local St. Louis CITY restaurants that are under $25 for one person, chains excluded. 

The best part? Great food and no obligation to go to the place suggested by your friend of a friend of a friend.
You get the idea.
Hit the "Let's Eat!" button and your culinary journey begins.
